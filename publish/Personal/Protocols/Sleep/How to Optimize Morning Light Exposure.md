| **How long**                 | ☀️Sunny day = 5–10 mins <br>⛅Cloudy day = 10–15 mins <br>☁️Overcast day = up to 30 mins                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **How to do it**             | Look towards the sunrise or sun, but **never stare directly at the sun**. Blink as necessary. Wearing contact lenses and prescription glasses are fine, but aim to avoid using sunglasses or hats that are meant to block sunlight from your eyes.                                                                            |
| **If you can't get outside** | Bright, blue-hued indoor lights will suffice, but try to get outdoors as soon as you can. Lux is a unit of measure of the intensity of light exposure to the human eye. Even on a cloudy day, outdoor light reaches around 10,000 lux, compared to a bright indoor light source, which is usually no brighter than 1,000 lux. |
