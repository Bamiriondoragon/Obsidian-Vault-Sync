#Sleep
**The Best way to recovery from a poor night's sleep is to make sure it doesn't affect  your next night sleep**
- [ ] **Get up at the same time as usual.** Sleeping more than **1 hour** **past your usual wakeup time** can shift your circadian clock later (called phase delay), making it harder to fall asleep that night.
- [ ] Ensure you get **adequate sunlight exposure** soon **after waking** to support a cortisol peak **early in the day**.
- [ ] Delay caffeine until **90â€“120 minutes** after waking to maximize the energy-boosting effects of your cup of coffee or tea.
- [ ] **Exercise in the morning** to encourage an early-day cortisol peak and provide a boost in adrenaline and focus.
