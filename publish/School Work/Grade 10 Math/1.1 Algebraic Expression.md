## How to solve
**Simplify**: Simplify the expressions by combining like terms and using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS - Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

$$x + 5x + 10 = 25 - x$$
$$
6x + 10 = 25 - x
$$
**Isolate** the variable: If the expression involves solving for a variable, isolate the variable on one side of the equation by performing inverse operations. For example, if the variable is being added, subtract it from both sides. If it's being multiplied, divide both sides.
$$
6x + x = 25 - 10
$$
$$
7x/7 = 15/7
$$
$$
x = 

$$
Check your **solution**: After solving the expression or equation, substitute the solution back into the original problem to ensure it satisfies all conditions.
