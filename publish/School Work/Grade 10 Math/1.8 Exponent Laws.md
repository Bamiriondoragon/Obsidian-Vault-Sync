# Exponent Laws

## Product rule
**The product rule** for exponents states: 
$xa⋅xb=xa+b$
## Quotient Rule
The **quotient rule** says that if we have exponents with the same base being divided, we can just subtract the exponents. In conclusion this is about dividing exponential expressions.
$\frac {a^m}{a^n} = a^m-n$
## Power rule
When taking a power of a power all you do is multiply the exponents.
$(a^m)^n=a^m*n$
## Zero Exponent

## Negative Exponent
