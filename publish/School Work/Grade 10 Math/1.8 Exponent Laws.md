# Exponent Laws

## Product rule
**The product rule** for exponents states: 
$xa⋅xb=xa+b$
## Quotient Rule
The **quotient rule** says that if we have exponents with the same base being divided, we can just subtract the exponents. Ultimately this is about dividing exponential expressions.

$\frac {a^m}{$
## Power rule

## Zero Exponent

## Negative Exponent
