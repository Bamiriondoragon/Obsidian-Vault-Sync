A prime number is **a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself**.

# Prime Factorization
> [!info] What is Prime Factorization
> "Prime Factorization" is finding **which prime numbers** multiply together to make the **original** number.
It is best to start working from the smallest prime number, which is 2, so let's check:
#### Example whole Numbers
**Prime Factorize the number 12**

$12 ÷ 2 = 6$

Yes, it divided exactly by 2. We have taken the first step!

But 6 is **not** a prime number, so we need to go further. Let's try 2 again:

$6 ÷ 2 = 3$

Yes, that worked also. And 3 **is** a prime number, so we have the answer:

$12 = 2 × 2 × 3$

As you can see, **every factor** is a **prime number**, so the answer is right.

# Factoring
This expression can be rewritten by removing the **GCF** (y +1)
$3x(y+1)+7z(y+1)1$ 
This then becomes
$(3x+7z)(y+1)$
### Factor Tree

![factor tree 48 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/images/factor-tree-48.svg)

**48 = 8 × 6**, so we write down "8" and "6" below 48

Now we continue and factor 8 into **4 × 2**

Then 4 into **2 × 2**

And lastly 6 into **3 × 2**

We can't factor any more, so we have found the prime factors.

Which reveals that $48 = 24 × 3$
