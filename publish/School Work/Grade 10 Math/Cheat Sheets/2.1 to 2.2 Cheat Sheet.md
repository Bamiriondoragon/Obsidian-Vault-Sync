## Factored Form of a Quadratic
This is the factored form of a quadratic $$
y =a(x-r)(x-s)
$$ The x-intercepts (called zeros) are **r** and **s**

### To determine the x-intercepts set factors to 0

$$
y = (x-4)(x+2)
$$
Here the x-intercepts are
$x  = 4$
$x = -2$ 

### Calculate Axis of Symmetry
This is how you calculate the axis of symmetry
And it is only the **X coordinate** of your vertex
$$x= \frac {r+s} 2 $$
$$
x = \frac {4+2} 2
$$
$$x = 1$$
### To Calculate Y coordinate of Vertex
Subsite the the axis of symmetry back into the original equation and solve for y
# Solving System With Substitution
1. Isolate a variable
2. Substitute the expression for this variable into the other equation
3. Solve the resulting linear equation
4. Substitute the solved value into one equation to determine the variable


> [!NOTE] Special cases when you are solving if you get:
> $0x = 0$ for example $-x = 0$  or $0y = 0$, there are **infinite** solution's)
> 
> $0x = num$ for example $0x = 3$  or $0y = -1$, there are **no** solution's)
