## Factored Form of a Quadratic
This is the factored form of a quadratic $$
y =a(x-r)(x-s)
$$ The x-intercepts (called zeros) are **r** and **s**

To determine the x-intercepts set factors to 

1. Isolate a variable
2. Substitute the expression for this variable into the other equation
3. Solve the resulting linear equation
4. Substitute the solved value into one equation to determine the variable
