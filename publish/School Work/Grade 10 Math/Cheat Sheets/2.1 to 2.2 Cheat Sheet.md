## Factored Form of a Quadratic
This is the factored form of a quadratic $$
y =a(x-r)(x-s)
$$ The x-intercepts (called zeros) are **r** and **s**

### To determine the x-intercepts set factors to 0

$$
y = (x-4)(x+2)
$$
Here the x-intercepts are
$x  = 4$
$x = -2$ c

### Calculate Axis of Symmetry
This is how you calculate the axis of symmetry
And it is only the **X coordinate** of your vertex
$$x= \frac {r+s} 2 $$
$$
x = \frac {4+2} 2
$$


1. Isolate a variable
2. Substitute the expression for this variable into the other equation
3. Solve the resulting linear equation
4. Substitute the solved value into one equation to determine the variable
