## Parent function
This is what **all** other [[1.2 Introduction to Quadratic Relations|parabolas]] **from** that being $y =x^2$
 ```desmos-graph
left=-10; right=10;
top=10; bottom=-5;
---
y=x^2
```


## Translation
###  Horizontal
$y = (x-5)^2$
Because the exponent is on the outside of the bracket this results in a horizontal change to the right it is inversed because of the exponent

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Green = New function</mark>

 ```desmos-graph
left=-10; right=10;
top=10; bottom=-5;
---
y=x^2
y=(x - 5)^2
```
We can state that horizontal value is equal to
$h=-2$

### Vertical
$y = x^2 + 2$
Because the exponent is attached to the **X** this means the **plus** 2 will **vertically** effect the **parabola** 
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Blue = Parent Function</mark>
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Green = New function</mark>
 ```desmos-graph
left=-10; right=10;
top=10; bottom=-5;
---
y=x^2
y=x^2+2
```
We can state that the value of **k** is,
$k=2$

### Horizontal and Vertical
$y=(x^2-5)+2$
In this equation there is a **K** value as well as a **H** value

 ```desmos-graph
left=-10; right=10;
top=12; bottom=-5;
---
y=x^2
y=(x^2-5)+2
```

From the formula we can state that the value of **h** and **k** is 
$$
\begin{align}  
&h =-5 \\
&k = 2
\end{align}  
$$
