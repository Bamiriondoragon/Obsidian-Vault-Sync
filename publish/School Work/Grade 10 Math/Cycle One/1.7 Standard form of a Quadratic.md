> All other quadratic formulas represent this graph in some way.

Given quadratics in standard form:
 $y =ax^2 + bx + c$
 
 If the value is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Positive</mark> the graph,
  If the value is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Negative</mark> the graph,
  The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">C</mark> value is the,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> y-intercept</mark>

# Calculate y-intercept
 

> [!question]
> A ball is thrown upwards from a balcony. The height, h, in meters, of the ball above the ground after t seconds can be found using the relation
> $h=-4.9t^2+15t+2$
### What was the height of the balcony.
To calculate the [[1.2 Introduction to Quadratic Relations|Y-intercept]] replace **t** for **0**
$$
\begin{align}
& h=-4.9t^2+15t+2\\
& h=-4.9(0)^2+15(0)+2\\
& h=2
\end{align}

$$
