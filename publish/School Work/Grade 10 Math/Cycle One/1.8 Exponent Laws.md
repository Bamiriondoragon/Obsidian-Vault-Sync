# Exponent Laws

## Product rule
**The product rule** for exponents states: 
$x^a⋅x^b=x^{a+b}$
## Quotient Rule
The **quotient rule** says that if we have exponents with the same base being divided, we can just subtract the exponents. In conclusion this is about dividing exponential expressions.
$\frac {a^m}{a^n} = a^m-n$
## Power rule
When taking a power of a power all you do is multiply the exponents.
$(a^m)^n=a^{m*n}$
## Zero Exponent
if you raise a **nonzero** number to the power of **0**, the result is **1**.
$4^0 =1$
## Negative Exponent
You take the reciprocal of the base and put it under 1
$4^{-2} = \frac 1 4^2$
