> [!info] What is Group Factoring
> Some time there is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">no common factor</mark> GCF in a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Four Term</mark> polynomial but we can group terms that do have a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">common factor </mark>this is called **factor by grouping**
To factor by grouping:
## To Group Factor 
- Group terms that have a common factor
- Common factor within each “group”
- Common factor out the GCF

\begin{align}
xy + yz + wx + wz \\ \\
= (xy + yz)(wx + wz)\\
= y(x + z) + w(x+z)\\
= (x+z)(y+w) &&
\end{align}
