# Pedigrees
## Overview
- **Definition**: A pedigree is a diagram that maps family relationships and the inheritance of specific traits or [[Genetic Disorders]] across generations.
## Purpose
- To **track** the inheritance patterns of traits or diseases within a family.
- To identify carriers of [[Genetic Disorders]].
- To assess the likelihood of [[Genetic Disorders]] in offspring.

## Symbols Used in Pedigrees
1. **Squares**: Represent males.
2. **Circles**: Represent females.
3. **Shaded Shapes**: Indicate affected individuals with the trait or disorder.
4. **Half-Shaded Shapes**: Denote carriers (heterozygous individuals) of a recessive trait.
5. **Horizontal Lines**: Represent marriages or unions between individuals.
6. **Vertical Lines**: Indicate offspring from a union.

## Steps to Analyze a Pedigree
1. **Identify the Trait**: Determine whether the trait is dominant or recessive based on its distribution in the pedigree.
2. **Determine Genotypes**:
   - **Recessive Traits**: If an individual is ==affected, both parents must carry at least one** recessive allele.==
   - **Dominant Traits**: If an individual is affected, ==at least one parent must also be affected.==
3. **Label Individuals**: Use consistent allele notation (e.g., "A" and "a" for albinism).
4. **Count Generations**: Number the generations to track inheritance over time.
## Inheritance Patterns
- **Autosomal Dominant**: Trait appears in every generation; affected individuals have at least one affected parent.
- **Autosomal Recessive**: Trait may skip generations; affected individuals can have unaffected parents (carriers).
- **X-Linked Recessive**: More common in males; affected males cannot pass the trait to sons but can pass it to daughters (who become carriers).
- **X-Linked Dominant**: Affected males pass the trait to all daughters but not to sons.
## Example Analysis
- **Trait**: Color blindness (X-linked recessive).
- **Pedigree Analysis**: 
  - Identify affected males and females.
  - Determine carrier status of females based on affected offspring.
  - Predict the likelihood of color blindness in future generations.

## Summary
Pedigrees are valuable tools in genetics for visualizing family histories and understanding the inheritance of traits.
