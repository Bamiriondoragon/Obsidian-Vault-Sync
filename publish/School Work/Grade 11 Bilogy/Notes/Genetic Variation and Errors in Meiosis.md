# Genetic Variation and Errors in Meiosis
## Genetic Variation
- **Definition**: Genetic variation refers to the differences in DNA sequences among individuals, contributing to diversity within a population.
- **Mechanisms**:
  - **Crossing Over**: Occurs during Prophase I of [[Meiosis]], where non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material, leading to new allele combinations.
  - **Independent Assortment**: Homologous chromosomes are distributed randomly into gametes, resulting in varied genetic combinations.

## Errors in Meiosis
- **Types of Errors**:
  - **Non-Disjunction**: Failure of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids to separate properly during [[Meiosis]], leading to aneuploidy.
    - **Aneuploidy**: Condition of having an incorrect number of chromosomes.
      - **Monosomy**: One chromosome is missing (n - 1).
      - **Polysomy**: Additional chromosome(s) present (n + 1).
  
- **Consequences**:
  - Can result in a wide range of [[Genetic Disorders]], which may vary in severity and impact on development and survival of offspring.

## Summary
- Genetic variation is crucial for evolution and adaptation, while errors in [[Meiosis]] can lead to significant [[Genetic Disorders]], highlighting the importance of accurate chromosome segregation during gamete formation.
