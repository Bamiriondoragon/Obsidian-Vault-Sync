# Dihybrid Cross
## Key Concepts
1. **Traits**: Two characteristics being studied (e.g., seed shape and seed color in pea plants).
2. **Alleles**: Different forms of a gene for each trait (e.g., R = round seeds, r = wrinkled seeds; Y = yellow seeds, y = green seeds).
3. **Genotype**: The genetic makeup for both traits (e.g., RrYy).

## Steps to Perform a Dihybrid Cross
1. **Create a Legend**: Define alleles for each trait (e.g., R = round, r = wrinkled; Y = yellow, y = green).
2. **Determine Parent Genotypes**: Identify the genotypes of the parents (e.g., RrYy x RrYy).
3. **Gamete Formation**: Determine the possible gametes for each parent by combining alleles (e.g., RY, Ry, rY, ry).
4. **Draw a Punnett Square**: Create a 4x4 Punnett square to represent all possible combinations of gametes from both parents.
5. **Fill in the Punnett Square**: Populate the inner boxes with the resulting genotypes from the gamete combinations.
6. **Calculate Ratios**:
   - **Genotype Ratio**: Count and express the ratios of the resulting genotypes.
   - **Phenotype Ratio**: Count and express the ratios of the resulting phenotypes.

## Example
- **Legend**: 
  - R = round seeds, r = wrinkled seeds
  - Y = yellow seeds, y = green seeds
- **Parent Genotypes**: RrYy x RrYy
- **Gametes**: RY, Ry, rY, ry (for both parents)
- **Punnett Square Results**:
  - **Genotype Ratio**: 1 RRYY : 2 RRYy : 2 RrYY : 4 RrYy : 1 RRyy : 2 Rryy : 1 rryy
  - **Phenotype Ratio**: 9 Round Yellow : 3 Round Green : 3 Wrinkled Yellow : 1 Wrinkled Green

## Summary
A dihybrid cross shows independent assortment, showing how two traits can be inherited together.
