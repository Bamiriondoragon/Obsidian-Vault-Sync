## Genetic Material

- DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid): A macromolecule that carries genetic information, found in the nucleus of ==eukaryotic== cells.   
## Structure of DNA

1. **DNA is a polymer of Nucleotides:**
- A sugar-phosphate backbone
- One nitrogenous base (A, T, G, C)

3. **Nitrogenous Base Pairs:**
- Adenine (A) with Thymine (T)
- Guanine (G) with Cytosine (C)

## Chromosomes

- A chromosome is made up of coiled DNA wrapped around histones.
- Chromosomes are found in the nucleus of each cell.
- Humans have ==46== chromosomes.  

**DNA Organization in the Cell**

- The DNA double helix is wound around proteins called **histones**.
- The DNA/histones are further ==coiled== and ==supercoiled== and **condensed** into chromosomes.  
## Karyotypes

- A karyotype is a person’s **particular** set **of** chromosomes.
- Chromosomes are collected and stained when a cell is in metaphase, appearing as sister chromatid “Xs.”
- Humans have **23** pairs of **chromosomes** (**46** in total).  
## Autosomal vs. Sex Chromosomes

- Humans have **22** pairs of autosomal (regular) chromosomes.
- Humans have 1 pair of sex chromosomes:

- **XX** if genetically female
- **XY** if genetically male  

## XX and XY

- **Sex determination factors:**

- Number and type of sex chromosomes
- Type of private parts— ovaries or testicles, and reproductive anatomy
- Sex hormone levels
- **Intersex**: A term for conditions where a person is born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn't fit **typical** **definitions** of female or male.  
## Chromosome Numbers in Other Species

- Mosquitoes: **6**
- Onions: **16**
## DNA to Traits

- **Genes**: A segment of DNA that codes for a particular trait; found at a specific location on a chromosome.

-  **Locus**: The location of a gene on a chromosome. 
- **Genes** (made of DNA) code for proteins, which make up the traits of species. Genes are the basis for inheritance of traits. Your body can read your DNA and produce specific proteins leading to the expression of a trait.
