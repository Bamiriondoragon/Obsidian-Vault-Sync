# Genetic Disorders

## Overview
- **Definition**: Genetic disorders are diseases or conditions caused by abnormalities in an individual's DNA, which can be inherited or arise spontaneously.

## Types of Genetic Disorders

### 1. **Autosomal Dominant Disorders**
- **Definition**: Disorders caused by a mutation in a single copy of a gene on an autosome (non-sex chromosome).
- **Examples**:
  - **Huntington's Disease**: Neurodegenerative disorder; symptoms appear in mid-adulthood.
  - **Marfan Syndrome**: Connective tissue disorder affecting the heart, eyes, and skeleton.

### 2. **Autosomal Recessive Disorders**
- **Definition**: Disorders that require two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) for the condition to manifest.
- **Examples**:
  - **Cystic Fibrosis**: Affects the respiratory and digestive systems; caused by mutations in the CFTR gene.
  - **Sickle Cell Anemia**: A blood disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin; leads to misshaped red blood cells.

### 3. **X-Linked Disorders**
- **Definition**: Disorders caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome; often more severe in males.
- **Examples**:
  - **Hemophilia**: A bleeding disorder due to lack of clotting factors.
  - **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**: Progressive muscle degeneration and weakness.

### 4. **Chromosomal Disorders**
- **Definition**: Disorders caused by abnormalities in chromosome number or structure.
- **Examples**:
  - **Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)**: Caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21; leads to developmental delays and characteristic features.
  - **Turner Syndrome**: Affects females; caused by the absence of one X chromosome (45,X); leads to short stature and infertility.

### 5. **Mitochondrial Disorders**
- **Definition**: Disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, affecting energy production.
- **Examples**:
  - **Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)**: Leads to vision loss due to retinal cell death.
  - **Mitochondrial Myopathy**: Muscle weakness and pain due to energy production issues.

## Diagnosis and Testing
- **Genetic Testing**: Identifies changes in chromosomes, genes, or proteins to confirm or rule out genetic conditions.
- **Prenatal Testing**: Includes amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) to detect genetic disorders before birth.

## Management and Treatment
- **Supportive Care**: Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and educational support for affected individuals.
- **Medications**: To manage symptoms (e.g., insulin for diabetes).
- **Gene Therapy**: Experimental treatments aimed at correcting genetic defects.

## Summary
Genetic disorders encompass a wide range of conditions caused by mutations in genes or chromosomal abnormalities.
