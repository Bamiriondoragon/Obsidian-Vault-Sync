# Sex-linked Inheritance
## Overview
- **Definition**: Sex-linked inheritance refers to the transmission of genes located on the sex chromosomes (X and Y), which can lead to traits that are expressed differently in males and females.
## Key Concepts
1. **Sex Chromosomes**:
   - **Females**: ==XX== (two X chromosomes).
   - **Males**: ==XY== (one X and one Y chromosome).

2. **X-Linked Traits**:
   - Traits associated with genes **on** the **X chromosome.**
   - **Males are more likely** to express X-linked recessive traits because they have only one X chromosome.
   - Examples: Color blindness, hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

3. **Y-Linked Traits**:
   - Traits associated with genes on the Y chromosome.
   - Only males can inherit Y-linked traits, passed from father to son.
   - Example: Y chromosome infertility.


## Inheritance Patterns
- **X-Linked Recessive**:
  - Affected males (X^rY) cannot pass the trait to sons (who inherit the Y chromosome) but will pass it to all daughters (who become carriers, X^rX).
  - Carrier females (X^RX^r) have a 50% chance of passing the recessive allele to sons (who will be affected) and daughters (who may be carriers).

- **X-Linked Dominant**:
  - Affected males (X^RY) pass the trait to all daughters (who will be affected) but not to sons.
  - Affected females (X^RX^r or X^RX^R) have a 50% chance of passing the trait to both sons and daughters.

## Examples
- **Color Blindness**:
  - X^r = color blind allele
    X^R = normal vision allele.
  - A mother who is a carrier (X^RX^r) has a 50% chance of having a color-blind son (X^rY)

- **Hemophilia**:
  - A recessive disorder affecting blood clotting, primarily seen in males.
## Summary
Sex-linked inheritance highlights the differences in how traits are passed down through the X and Y chromosomes.
