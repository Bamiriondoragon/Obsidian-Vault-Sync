# Incomplete Dominance and Codominance
## Incomplete Dominance
- **Definition**: A form of inheritance where neither allele is completely dominant over the other, resulting in a blended phenotype in the heterozygous condition.
- **Example**: Snapdragon flower color.
  - **Alleles**: R (red) and r (white).
  - **Cross**: RR (red) x rr (white) â†’ F1 generation is Rr (pink).
- **Genotype Ratio**: 1 RR : 2 Rr : 1 rr.
- **Phenotype Ratio**: 1 Red : 2 Pink : 1 White.

## Co-Dominance
- **Definition**: A form of inheritance where both alleles are fully expressed in the phenotype of the heterozygote, resulting in a distinct phenotype that shows both traits.
- **Example**: Blood type in humans.
  - **Alleles**: A (IA), B (IB), and O (i).
  - **Cross**: IAIB (type AB) shows both A and B antigens.
- **Genotype Ratio**: Varies based on the specific cross.
- **Phenotype Ratio**: For IAIB x ii, the ratio is 1 Type A : 1 Type B.

## Key Differences
- **Phenotype Expression**:
  - Incomplete Dominance: Blended phenotype (e.g., pink flowers).
  - Co-Dominance: Both phenotypes expressed distinctly (e.g., AB blood type).
  
## Summary
- Incomplete dominance results in a **mix** of traits, while co-dominance results in the **expression of both traits** without blending. Both patterns illustrate the complexity of inheritance beyond simple dominant-recessive relationships.
