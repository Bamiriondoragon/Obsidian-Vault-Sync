# Cell cycle and Mitosis
## Overview

- Each human cell has **46 chromosomes.**

- **22** pairs are autosomes.
- **1** pair are **sex** chromosomes.

- Mitosis ensures every human cell maintains 46 chromosomes.
- Occurs in somatic cells (body cells).
- Produces two identical daughter cells from one parent cell. 

### The Cell Cycle

1. **Interphase**

- G1 Phase: Growth
- S Phase: DNA replication
- G2 Phase: Growth and preparation for division

3. **Mitosis**
4. **Cytokinesis**  
     

## Mitosis Stages

1. **Prophase**

- Chromatin condenses to form chromosomes.
- Nuclear membrane breaks down.
- Duplicated centrioles migrate to opposite poles.
- Spindle fibers begin to form.

3. **Metaphase**

- Spindle fibers attach to chromosome centromeres.
- Chromosomes align along the equatorial plate.
- Sister chromatids face opposite poles.

5. **Anaphase**

- Centromere splits.
- Sister chromatids are pulled to opposite poles by spindle fibers.

7. **Telophase**

- Nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromatids.
- Spindle fibers disappear.
- Chromatids decondense to chromatin.  
     

**Cytokinesis**

- Division of the cytoplasm.
- Occurs at the end of mitosis and the beginning of interphase.

## Functions of Cell Division & Mitosis

- Growth of the organism
- Repair of tissues and organs
- Injuries to cells
- Maintenance
- Replace old or dead cells
