# Mendelian Genetics â€“ Pea Plants and Terminology
## Overview
- **Definition**: Mendelian genetics is the study of how traits are inherited through generations, based on the principles established by Gregor Mendel through his experiments with pea plants.

## Key Concepts
1. **Traits**: Characteristics that can be observed and measured (e.g., flower color, seed shape).
2. **Alleles**: Different forms of a gene (e.g., dominant "A" and recessive "a").
3. **Genotype**: The genetic makeup of an organism (e.g., AA, Aa, aa).
4. **Phenotype**: The observable traits of an organism (e.g., purple or white flowers).

## Mendel's Laws
1. **Law of Segregation**:
   - During gamete formation, alleles for a trait separate so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene.
  
2. **Law of Independent Assortment**:
   - Alleles for different traits are distributed to gametes independently of one another, leading to genetic variation.

## Generations
- **P Generation**: The parental generation
- **F1 Generation**: The first generation, offspring of the P generation.
- **F2 Generation**: The second offspring  generation.

## Ratios
- **[[Monohybrid cross]]**: A cross involving one trait, typically results in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.
- **[[Dihybrid Cross]]**: A cross involving two traits, typically results in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.

## Summary
Mendelian genetics provides foundational principles for understanding heredity, emphasizing the roles of alleles, genotypes, and phenotypes, along with the laws governing inheritance patterns observed in pea plants.
