# Monohybrid cross
1. **Create a Legend**: Define what each allele represents (e.g., R for round seeds, r for wrinkled seeds).
2. **Determine Parent Genotypes**: Identify the genotypes of the parent plants (e.g., Rr for heterozygous, rr for homozygous recessive).
3. **Draw a Punnett Square**: Set up the Punnett square with the parents' alleles on the sides and fill in the inner boxes, placing dominant alleles first.
4. **Write Genotype Ratio**: Calculate and express the possible genotypes of the offspring (e.g., 1 Rr : 1 rr).
5. **Write Phenotype Ratio**: Calculate and express the phenotypes of the offspring (e.g., 1 Round : 1 Wrinkled).

## Sample Problem
- **Legend**: R = round seeds, r = wrinkled seeds
- **Parent Genotypes**: Rr (heterozygous) x rr (homozygous recessive)
- **Punnett Square Results**:
  - Genotype Ratio: 1 Rr : 1 rr
  - Phenotype Ratio: 1 Round : 1 Wrinkled

## Note
Other inheritance patterns exist that do not follow Mendelâ€™s laws, including **incomplete** **dominance**, **co-dominance**, **polygenic** inheritance**, and **[[Sex-linked Inheritance]]
