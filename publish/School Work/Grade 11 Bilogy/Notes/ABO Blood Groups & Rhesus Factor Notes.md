# ABO Blood Groups & Rhesus Factor Notes
- **Definition**: The ABO blood group system classifies human blood into four main types based on the presence or absence of specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells.  
### Blood Types
1. **Type A**:
   - Antigen: A
   - Antibodies: Anti-B
2. **Type B**:
   - Antigen: B
   - Antibodies: Anti-A
3. **Type AB** (Universal Recipient):
   - Antigens: A and B
   - Antibodies: None
4. **Type O** (Universal Donor):
   - Antigens: None
   - Antibodies: Anti-A and Anti-B

### Inheritance
- **Multiple Alleles**: The ABO blood group is determined by three alleles: IA (A), IB (B), and i (O).
- **Genotype Combinations**:
  - Type A: IAIA or IAi
  - Type B: IBIB or IBi
  - Type AB: IAIB
  - Type O: ii

## Rhesus Factor (Rh Factor)
- **Definition**: The Rhesus factor is another blood group system that determines the presence (+) or absence (-) of the Rh antigen (D antigen) on red blood cells.

### Rh Blood Types
1. **Rh Positive (Rh+)**:
   - Presence of D antigen.
   - Can receive Rh+ or Rh- blood.
2. **Rh Negative (Rh-)**:
   - Absence of D antigen.
   - Can only receive Rh- blood.

### Inheritance
- **Rh Factor Alleles**: Rh+ is dominant (D), and Rh- is recessive (d).
- **Genotype Combinations**:
  - Rh+: DD or Dd
  - Rh-: dd

## Blood Transfusions
- **Compatibility**: Blood transfusions require matching ABO and Rh types to prevent immune reactions.
- **Mismatched Transfusions**: Can lead to serious complications, such as hemolytic reactions where red blood cells burst or clump.

## Summary
The ABO blood group system and the Rhesus factor are critical for blood typing and transfusion compatibility. Understanding these systems helps prevent adverse reactions during blood transfusions and informs medical decisions regarding pregnancy and organ transplantation.
