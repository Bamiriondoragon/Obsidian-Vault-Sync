# Polygenic Inheritance, Modifier Genes, Multiple Alleles
## Polygenic Inheritance
- **Definition**: A type of inheritance where multiple genes (often located on different chromosomes) contribute to a single trait, resulting in a continuous range of phenotypes.
- **Examples**: 
  - Human traits such as skin color, height, and eye color.
  - Traits often show a bell-shaped distribution in a population.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Traits are influenced by the additive effects of several alleles.
  - Environmental factors can also impact the expression of polygenic traits.

## Modifier Genes
- **Definition**: Genes that can influence the expression of other genes, either enhancing or suppressing the effects of the primary gene.
- **Examples**:
  - In coat color in animals, a **modifier** gene may **affect** the **intensity** or **pattern** of the primary color gene.
  - In humans, modifier genes can influence the **severity** of [[Genetic Disorders]].
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Modifier genes can lead to variations in phenotypes that are not solely determined by the primary gene.

## Multiple Alleles
- **Definition**: A situation where a gene has more than two alleles in the population, leading to a variety of possible genotypes and phenotypes.
- **Examples**:
  - Human blood types (A, B, AB, O) are determined by three alleles: **IA**, **IB**, and **i**.
  - Coat color in rabbits can be influenced by multiple alleles, leading to various colors and patterns.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - While an individual can only have two alleles for a gene (one from each parent), the presence of multiple alleles in the population increases genetic diversity.

## Summary
- **Polygenic inheritance** results in traits that exhibit a range of phenotypes due to the cumulative effects of multiple genes. 
- **Modifier genes** can alter the expression of other genes, leading to variations in traits. 
- **Multiple alleles** introduce more genetic diversity for a single trait, allowing for a wider array of phenotypes within a population.
