# Meiosis
## Overview
- **Definition**: Meiosis is a type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, producing gametes (sperm and eggs).
- **Purpose**: Essential for sexual reproduction and genetic diversity.
## Stages of Meiosis
1. **Interphase**: 
   -  Interphase
   -  Meiosis 1
   - Meiosis two
   - Cytokinesis

2. **Meiosis I (Reduction Division)**:
   - **Prophase I**: Chromosomes condense, homologous chromosomes pair (synapsis), and crossing over occurs.
   - **Metaphase I**: Tetrads align at the equatorial plate.
   - **Anaphase I**: Homologous chromosomes separate to opposite poles.
   - **Telophase I & Cytokinesis**: Two haploid daughter cells form.

3. **Meiosis II (Similar to Mitosis)**:
   - **Prophase II**: Chromosomes condense again, spindle fibers form.
   - **Metaphase II**: Chromosomes align at the equatorial plate.
   - **Anaphase II**: Sister chromatids separate to opposite poles.
   - **Telophase II & Cytokinesis**: Four haploid daughter cells are produced.
  
- **Genetic Variation**: 
  - Crossing over and independent assortment contribute to genetic diversity.

## Errors in Meiosis
- **Aneuploidy**: Incorrect number of chromosomes due to non-disjunction.
- **Monosomy**: One chromosome missing (n - 1).

## Importance
- Meiosis ensures the correct chromosome number in gametes and promotes genetic diversity through recombination.
