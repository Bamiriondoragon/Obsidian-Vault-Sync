# ABO Blood Groups & Rhesus Factor Notes
- **Definition**: The ABO blood group system classifies human blood into four main types based on the presence or absence of specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells.  
### Blood Types
1. **Type A**:
   - Antigen: A
   - Antibodies: Anti-B
2. **Type B**:
   - Antigen: B
   - Antibodies: Anti-A
3. **Type AB** (Universal Recipient):
   - Antigens: A and B
   - Antibodies: None
4. **Type O** (Universal Donor):
   - Antigens: None
   - Antibodies: Anti-A and Anti-B

### Inheritance
- **Multiple Alleles**: The ABO blood group is determined by three alleles: IA (A), IB (B), and i (O).
- **Genotype Combinations**:
  - Type A: IAIA or IAi
  - Type B: IBIB or IBi
  - Type AB: IAIB
  - Type O: ii

## Rhesus Factor (Rh Factor)
- **Definition**: The Rhesus factor is another blood group system that determines the presence (+) or absence (-) of the Rh antigen (D antigen) on red blood cells.

### Rh Blood Types
1. **Rh Positive (Rh+)**:
   - Presence of D antigen.
   - Can receive Rh+ or Rh- blood.
2. **Rh Negative (Rh-)**:
   - Absence of D antigen.
   - Can only receive Rh- blood.

### Inheritance
- **Rh Factor Alleles**: Rh+ is dominant (D), and Rh- is recessive (d).
- **Genotype Combinations**:
  - Rh+: DD or Dd
  - Rh-: dd

## Blood Transfusions
- **Compatibility**: Blood transfusions require matching ABO and Rh types to prevent immune reactions.
- **Mismatched Transfusions**: Can lead to serious complications, such as hemolytic reactions where red blood cells burst or clump.

## Steps to Perform a Dihybrid Cross
1. **Create a Legend**: Define alleles for each trait (e.g., R = round, r = wrinkled; Y = yellow, y = green).
2. **Determine Parent Genotypes**: Identify the genotypes of the parents (e.g., RrYy x RrYy).
3. **Gamete Formation**: Determine the possible gametes for each parent by combining alleles (e.g., RY, Ry, rY, ry).
4. **Draw a Punnett Square**: Create a 4x4 Punnett square to represent all possible combinations of gametes from both parents.
5. **Fill in the Punnett Square**: Populate the inner boxes with the resulting genotypes from the gamete combinations.
6. **Calculate Ratios**:
   - **Genotype Ratio**: Count and express the ratios of the resulting genotypes.
   - **Phenotype Ratio**: Count and express the ratios of the resulting phenotypes.

## Example
- **Legend**: 
  - R = round seeds, r = wrinkled seeds
  - Y = yellow seeds, y = green seeds
- **Parent Genotypes**: RrYy x RrYy
- **Gametes**: RY, Ry, rY, ry (for both parents)
- **Punnett Square Results**:
  - **Genotype Ratio**: 1 RRYY : 2 RRYy : 2 RrYY : 4 RrYy : 1 RRyy : 2 Rryy : 1 rryy

# Incomplete Dominance and Codominance
## Incomplete Dominance
- **Definition**: A form of inheritance where neither allele is completely dominant over the other, resulting in a blended phenotype in the heterozygous condition.
- **Example**: Snapdragon flower color.
  - **Alleles**: R (red) and r (white).
  - **Cross**: RR (red) x rr (white) → F1 generation is Rr (pink).
- **Genotype Ratio**: 1 RR : 2 Rr : 1 rr.
- **Phenotype Ratio**: 1 Red : 2 Pink : 1 White.
![](file:///C:%5CUsers%5CJaden%5CDesktop%5CObsidian%5CSchool%5Cremote-blog%5Cpublish%5CSchool%20Work%5CGrade%2011%20Bilogy%5CFIles%5CPasted%20image%2020241113142406.png)
## Co-Dominance
- **Definition**: A form of inheritance where both alleles are fully expressed in the phenotype of the heterozygote, resulting in a distinct phenotype that shows both traits.
- **Example**: Blood type in humans.
  - **Alleles**: A (IA), B (IB), and O (i).
  - **Cross**: IAIB (type AB) shows both A and B antigens.
- **Genotype Ratio**: Varies based on the specific cross.
- **Phenotype Ratio**: For IAIB x ii, the ratio is 1 Type A : 1 Type B.
![](file:///C:%5CUsers%5CJaden%5CDesktop%5CObsidian%5CSchool%5Cremote-blog%5Cpublish%5CSchool%20Work%5CGrade%2011%20Bilogy%5CFIles%5CPasted%20image%2020241113142348.png)
## Key Differences
- **Phenotype Expression**:
  - Incomplete Dominance: Blended phenotype (e.g., pink flowers).
  - Co-Dominance: Both phenotypes expressed distinctly (e.g., AB blood type).
  
## Summary
- Incomplete dominance results in a **mix** of traits, while co-dominance results in the **expression of both traits** without blending. Both patterns illustrate the complexity of inheritance beyond simple dominant-recessive relationships.
# Meiosis

# Mendelian Genetics – Pea Plants and Terminology
## Overview
- **Definition**: Mendelian genetics is the study of how traits are inherited through generations, based on the principles established by Gregor Mendel through his experiments with pea plants.

## Key Concepts
1. **Traits**: Characteristics that can be observed and measured (e.g., flower color, seed shape).
2. **Alleles**: Different forms of a gene (e.g., dominant "A" and recessive "a").
3. **Genotype**: The genetic makeup of an organism (e.g., AA, Aa, aa).
4. **Phenotype**: The observable traits of an organism (e.g., purple or white flowers).

## Mendel's Laws
1. **Law of Segregation**:
   - During gamete formation, alleles for a trait separate so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene.
  
2. **Law of Independent Assortment**:
   - Alleles for different traits are distributed to gametes independently of one another, leading to genetic variation.

## Generations
- **P Generation**: The parental generation
- **F1 Generation**: The first generation, offspring of the P generation.
- **F2 Generation**: The second offspring  generation.

## Ratios
- **[[Monohybrid cross]]**: A cross involving one trait, typically results in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.
- **[[Dihybrid Cross]]**: A cross involving two traits, typically results in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.

## Summary
Mendelian genetics provides foundational principles for understanding heredity, emphasizing the roles of alleles, genotypes, and phenotypes, along with the laws governing inheritance patterns observed in pea plants.
# Monohybrid cross
1. **Create a Legend**: Define what each allele represents (e.g., R for round seeds, r for wrinkled seeds).
2. **Determine Parent Genotypes**: Identify the genotypes of the parent plants (e.g., Rr for heterozygous, rr for homozygous recessive).
3. **Draw a Punnett Square**: Set up the Punnett square with the parents' alleles on the sides and fill in the inner boxes, placing dominant alleles first.
4. **Write Genotype Ratio**: Calculate and express the possible genotypes of the offspring (e.g., 1 Rr : 1 rr).
5. **Write Phenotype Ratio**: Calculate and express the phenotypes of the offspring (e.g., 1 Round : 1 Wrinkled).
![](file:///C:%5CUsers%5CJaden%5CDesktop%5CObsidian%5CSchool%5Cremote-blog%5Cpublish%5CSchool%20Work%5CGrade%2011%20Bilogy%5CFIles%5CPasted%20image%2020241113141008.png)
## Sample Problem
- **Legend**: R = round seeds, r = wrinkled seeds
- **Parent Genotypes**: Rr (heterozygous) x rr (homozygous recessive)
- **Punnett Square Results**:
  - Genotype Ratio: 1 Rr : 1 rr
  - Phenotype Ratio: 1 Round : 1 Wrinkled

## Note
Other inheritance patterns exist that do not follow Mendel’s laws, including **incomplete** **dominance**, **co-dominance**, **polygenic** inheritance**, and **[[Sex-linked Inheritance]]


# Pedigrees
## Overview
- **Definition**: A pedigree is a diagram that maps family relationships and the inheritance of specific traits or [[Genetic Disorders]] across generations.
## Purpose
- To **track** the inheritance patterns of traits or diseases within a family.
- To identify carriers of [[Genetic Disorders]].
- To assess the likelihood of [[Genetic Disorders]] in offspring.

## Symbols Used in Pedigrees
1. **Squares**: Represent males.
2. **Circles**: Represent females.
3. **Shaded Shapes**: Indicate affected individuals with the trait or disorder.
4. **Half-Shaded Shapes**: Denote carriers (heterozygous individuals) of a recessive trait.
5. **Horizontal Lines**: Represent marriages or unions between individuals.
6. **Vertical Lines**: Indicate offspring from a union.

## Steps to Analyze a Pedigree
1. **Identify the Trait**: Determine whether the trait is dominant or recessive based on its distribution in the pedigree.
2. **Determine Genotypes**:
   - **Recessive Traits**: If an individual is ==affected, both parents must carry at least one** recessive allele.==
   - **Dominant Traits**: If an individual is affected, ==at least one parent must also be affected.==
3. **Label Individuals**: Use consistent allele notation (e.g., "A" and "a" for albinism).
4. **Count Generations**: Number the generations to track inheritance over time.
## Inheritance Patterns
- **Autosomal Dominant**: Trait appears in every generation; affected individuals have at least one affected parent.
- **Autosomal Recessive**: Trait may skip generations; affected individuals can have unaffected parents (carriers).
- **X-Linked Recessive**: More common in males; affected males cannot pass the trait to sons but can pass it to daughters (who become carriers).
- **X-Linked Dominant**: Affected males pass the trait to all daughters but not to sons.
## Example Analysis
- **Trait**: Color blindness (X-linked recessive).
- **Pedigree Analysis**: 
  - Identify affected males and females.
  - Determine carrier status of females based on affected offspring.
  - Predict the likelihood of color blindness in future generations.

## Summary
[[Pedigrees]] are valuable tools in genetics for visualizing family histories and understanding the inheritance of traits. 
# Polygenic Inheritance, Modifier Genes, Multiple Alleles
## Polygenic Inheritance
- **Definition**: A type of inheritance where multiple genes (often located on different chromosomes) contribute to a single trait, resulting in a continuous range of phenotypes.
- **Examples**: 
  - Human traits such as skin color, height, and eye color.
  - Traits often show a bell-shaped distribution in a population.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Traits are influenced by the additive effects of several alleles.
  - Environmental factors can also impact the expression of polygenic traits.

- **Definition**: Genes that can influence the expression of other genes, either enhancing or suppressing the effects of the primary gene.
- **Examples**:
  - In coat color in animals, a **modifier** gene may **affect** the **intensity** or **pattern** of the primary color gene.
  - In humans, modifier genes can influence the **severity** of [[Genetic Disorders]].
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Modifier genes can lead to variations in phenotypes that are not solely determined by the primary gene.

## Multiple Alleles
- **Definition**: A situation where a gene has more than two alleles in the population, leading to a variety of possible genotypes and phenotypes.
- **Examples**:
  - Human blood types (A, B, AB, O) are determined by three alleles: **IA**, **IB**, and **i**.
  - Coat color in rabbits can be influenced by multiple alleles, leading to various colors and patterns.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - While an individual can only have two alleles for a gene (one from each parent), the presence of multiple alleles in the population increases genetic diversity.

## Summary
- **Polygenic inheritance** results in traits that exhibit a range of phenotypes due to the cumulative effects of multiple genes. 
- **Modifier genes** can alter the expression of other genes, leading to variations in traits. 
- **Multiple alleles** introduce more genetic diversity for a single trait, allowing for a wider array of phenotypes within a population.
# Sex-linked Inheritance
## Overview
- **Definition**: [[Sex-linked Inheritance]] refers to the transmission of genes located on the sex chromosomes (X and Y), which can lead to traits that are expressed differently in males and females.
## Key Concepts
1. **Sex Chromosomes**:
   - **Females**: ==XX== (two X chromosomes).
   - **Males**: ==XY== (one X and one Y chromosome).

2. **X-Linked Traits**:
   - Traits associated with genes **on** the **X chromosome.**
   - **Males are more likely** to express X-linked recessive traits because they have only one X chromosome.
   - Examples: Color blindness, hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

3. **Y-Linked Traits**:
   - Traits associated with genes on the Y chromosome.
   - Only males can inherit Y-linked traits, passed from father to son.
   - Example: Y chromosome infertility.


## Inheritance Patterns
- **X-Linked Recessive**:
  - Affected males (X^rY) cannot pass the trait to sons (who inherit the Y chromosome) but will pass it to all daughters (who become carriers, X^rX).
  - Carrier females (X^RX^r) have a 50% chance of passing the recessive allele to sons (who will be affected) and daughters (who may be carriers).

- **X-Linked Dominant**:
  - Affected males (X^RY) pass the trait to all daughters (who will be affected) but not to sons.
  - Affected females (X^RX^r or X^RX^R) have a 50% chance of passing the trait to both sons and daughters.

## Examples
- **Color Blindness**:
  - X^r = color blind allele
    X^R = normal vision allele.
  - A mother who is a carrier (X^RX^r) has a 50% chance of having a color-blind son (X^rY)

- **Hemophilia**:
  - A recessive disorder affecting blood clotting, primarily seen in males.
## Summary
[[Sex-linked Inheritance]] highlights the differences in how traits are passed down through the X and Y chromosomes.
