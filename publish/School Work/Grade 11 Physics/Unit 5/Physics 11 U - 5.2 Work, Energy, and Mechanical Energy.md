# Physics Notes: Work, Energy, and Mechanical Energy

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Energy**
- The ability to do work, existing in various forms (kinetic, potential, etc.).

### 2. **Kinetic Energy (Ek)**
- Energy possessed by an object due to its motion.
- Formula: $$Ek = \frac{mv^2}{2} $$

### 3. **Gravitational Potential Energy (Eg)**
- Energy an object possesses due to its position relative to the Earth's surface.
- Formula: $$ Eg = mgh $$ (where \( h \) is height above a reference level).

### 4. **Mechanical Energy**
- The sum of kinetic and gravitational potential energy.
- Example: A hockey puck sliding on ice has kinetic energy but no gravitational potential energy.

### 5. **Work-Energy Principle**
- The net work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy.
- Formula: $$W_{net} = \Delta Ek $$

### 6. **Reference Level**
- A designated height where gravitational potential energy is considered 0 J.

## Sample Problems

### Problem 1: Car Acceleration
- A 1300 kg car accelerates from rest to 14 m/s over 82 m.
  - (a) Net work done: 130 kJ
  - (b) Net force: 1.6 x 10³ N

### Problem 2: Hockey Player
- A 52 kg player moving at 11 m/s stops over 8.0 m.
  - (a) Net force: 390 N (backwards)
  - (b) Net work is negative due to deceleration and energy loss.

### Problem 3: Slide and Gravitational Potential Energy
- A 42 kg person slides down a slide.
  - (a) Calculate $Eg$ at position A.
  - (b) $Eg$ at position B: 4500 J, find height.
  - (c) Loss of $Eg$ from A to C: 4900 J, find height at C.
  - (d) $Eg$ at ground level (D): 0 J.

## Important Relationships
- **Mechanical Energy**: $( E_{mechanical} = Ek + Eg$
- **Units**: 1 $N·m = 1 J (Joules)$
