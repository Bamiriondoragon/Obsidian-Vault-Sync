## Key Concepts

1. **Work Done (W)**:
   - Formula: $$( W = F \cdot \Delta d \cdot \cos(u) )$$
   - Work is done when a force causes displacement.

2. **Sections of Work**:
   - **Section A, B, C**: Calculate work done in each section based on force and displacement.
   - **Total Work**: Sum of work done in all sections.

3. **Negative Work**:
   - Work done in section C is negative because the force acts opposite to the direction of displacement.

## Methods to Determine Total Work
1. **Graphical Method**: Use a force vs. displacement graph to find the area under the curve.
2. **Calculative Method**: Sum the work done by individual forces acting on the object.

## Force and Work Relationship
- **Perpendicular Force**: 
  - If the force is perpendicular to displacement, $$ \cos(90^\circ) = 0 $$, thus no work is done.
  
- **Opposite Force**: 
  - If the force is opposite to displacement, $$ \cos(180^\circ) = -1 $$, resulting in negative work.

## Example Problems
1. **Net Work on a Bowl**:
   - Force applied: 4.5 N, Friction: 2.8 N
   - Net Work: $$ 4.5 \, \text{N} - 2.8 \, \text{N} = 2.2 \, \text{J} $$
2. **Mechanical Work by a Crane**:
   - Mass of beam: 450 kg, Height: 12 m
   - Work done: $$ W = mgh = 450 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \cdot 12 \, \text{m} = 53 \, \text{kJ} $$
