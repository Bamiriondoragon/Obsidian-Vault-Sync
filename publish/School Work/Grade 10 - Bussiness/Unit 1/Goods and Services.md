## Goods
- Tangible: Goods are physical objects that can be seen, touched, and felt.
- Produced: They are typically manufactured or produced through some form of labour and resources.
- Transferable: Goods can be bought, sold, and transferred from one person or entity to another.

## Service
-  Intangible: Services are activities, performances, or benefits that one party can offer to another, which are intangible and cannot be touched.
- Performed: Services are actions performed by individuals or organizations to fulfil a need or desire.
-  Inseparable: In many cases, services are provided and consumed simultaneously. For example, a haircut is provided and consumed at the same time.
- Non-transferable: Unlike goods, services are often not transferable from one person to another. Once a service is consumed, it cannot be passed on to someone else.


> [!abstract] Summary
> Both goods and services are essential components of the economy, with goods typically being tangible products and services being intangible actions or performances. They are exchanged in markets where consumers and products meet.
